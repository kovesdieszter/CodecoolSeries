# Codecool Series
- This is a small web application on Python/Flask with PostgreSQL database.
- It contains a really basic DOM manipulation with Javascript.
- Filter with SQL: SQL: collecting all actors with their name, age (or age at death, if deceased) and number of shows the actor played in. Order the most active actor on top of the result.
- When the user hovers the cursor on any of these actors the following happens:

    If deceased: the card background will be dark and the text color will be white.
